// A pack whose shipped files changed must bump its version.
//
// A host caches an installed pack by `<marketplace>__<name>__<version>` and never
// re-fetches a version it already holds. A change that ships under the SAME
// version therefore never reaches anyone who installed it before: their Browser
// pack kept the old app/server.mjs after dimension-community#119 until they
// uninstalled and reinstalled (Traction Night friction #63). This check compares
// every pack against the base it will merge into and refuses a changed pack whose
// package.json version is unchanged. Tests are not shipped, so test/ is exempt.
//
// The same walk holds the README rule (docs/plugins/authoring.md, "Document it:
// README.md", in the Dimension repository): the details page in Capabilities shows
// a plugin's README.md, so a pack that is NEW against the base must ship one at its
// root or the check fails. A pack that already existed and still has none only
// prints a warning: the shelf is being brought up to the standard one pack at a time.
//
// Usage: bun scripts/check-version-bumps.mjs [baseRef]   (default: origin/main)

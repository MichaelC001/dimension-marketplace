// Cross-pack guard for the "asks in every mode" gate: a representative publish,
// send or irreversible-delete tool from each connector pack must resolve to a
// prompt in yolo mode, and the low-stakes writes that were deliberately left
// ungated must keep auto-approving there. One or two tools per pack, not an
// inventory — each pack's own tests own its full surface.
//
// Every pack is loaded through its default-exported factory and decided by the
// engine's own `resolveApproval` (the packs' `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` peer).
// google-drive registers its write tools only when the stored credential grants
// a write scope, so it is loaded with HOME pointed at a temp dir holding a
// write-scoped credential: `CONFIG_TARGET` is derived from `homedir()` at module
// load, so HOME is swapped around the dynamic import only and restored at once.

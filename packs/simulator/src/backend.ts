// THE seam between the pack and a platform.
//
// Everything above this file (the fleet, the frame relay, the MCP tools, the
// View) is platform-neutral: it speaks `DeviceBackend`. Everything below it is
// one platform's tools. Android ships (src/android). An iOS simulator is a
// macOS-host backend that implements this same interface with `xcrun simctl`; see
// the README for why it is not here.

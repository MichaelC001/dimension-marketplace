// The rule that keeps an agent off the person's own phone. Pure: no adb, no
// settings file, no clock, so every branch is provable with plain objects.
//
// Why it exists: an agent asked to use an EMULATOR once drove the owner's real
// phone, because it was the only device `adb devices` listed and the skill said
// "leave serial out when exactly one device runs". Three rules close that:
//
//   1. Classification   `classifyDevice` says emulator or physical. Anything that
//                       cannot be shown to be an emulator is physical (fail safe).
//   2. Default pick     With no `serial`, only an EMULATOR is chosen
//                       (`selectDefaultDevice`). A phone is never picked for you,
//                       not even when it is the only device.
//   3. Two keys         Acting on a physical device takes BOTH `allowPhysical: true`
//                       on the call AND the user's `simulator.allowPhysical`
//                       setting (`physicalAccessRefusal`). The call is the model's
//                       key; the setting is the person's.

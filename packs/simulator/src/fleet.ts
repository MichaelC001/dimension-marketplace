// The fleet: which virtual devices THIS pack booted, and the rules that keep
// them from outliving their use.
//
//   ownership   Only a device the pack booted is ever stopped by it, and "booted" means
//               a PROCESS: the record is {pid, startedAt} (plus the serial it answers
//               to, for display), and stop acts on that process tree after checking the
//               pid still started when the pack spawned it. A serial alone never stops
//               anything: serials are reused, and an emulator the person started
//               (Android Studio, a terminal) once got stopped by one. Such a device
//               is theirs: stop is refused, idle shutdown skips it, exit leaves it.
//   duplicates  `boot` asks every running emulator which AVD it is, and returns the one
//               that already runs the AVD (recorded as not owned) instead of starting a
//               second. A second instance takes an explicit `readOnly`.
//   cap         At most `simulator.maxDevices` booted at once.
//   idle        An owned device with no viewer and no tool call for
//               `simulator.idleMinutes` is stopped. One timer per device, set and
//               reset by events (a tool call, a viewer coming or going): nothing polls.
//   orphans     The ownership record is a file, so a crashed pack's emulators are
//               found again at the next start. A record is adopted only when its pid is
//               still running AND started when the record says, and its previous owner
//               is dead: never from `adb devices` alone, so an emulator the person
//               started since is never mistaken for ours.
//   exit        `shutdown()` stops what the pack booted.

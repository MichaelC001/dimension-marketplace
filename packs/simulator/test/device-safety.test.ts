/** WHAT BREAKS IN THE PRODUCT IF THIS GOES RED: an agent asked to use an
 *  EMULATOR drives the owner's own phone. That happened once for real (the only
 *  adb device was a USB phone, IV2201, and the serial may be left out), so the
 *  rules here are the whole safety net: anything that cannot be shown to be an
 *  emulator is a phone, a phone is never picked for you, and acting on one takes
 *  two keys (the call's allowPhysical AND the user's setting).

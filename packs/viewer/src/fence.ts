// The path fence: which files the viewer will open. Everything the model or the
// View can ask for passes `Fence.check` first, and `check` answers with a REAL
// path (symlinks resolved) or a refusal that names the reason.
//
// Policy (v1):
//   1. The path must be absolute and free of tricks (NUL, Windows device paths,
//      alternate data streams, network/UNC paths). The tricks are refused on the
//      text alone, BEFORE any filesystem call: `realpath` on `\\host\share` or a
//      WebDAV spelling would make the OS authenticate to a host the model chose.
//   2. DENY beats allow: private keys, `.env*`, credential and token stores, the
//      Personal vault's Locker (its `locker` folders, `_locker.json`,
//      `*.secret.json`), the engine's agent state and databases are refused
//      wherever they live, even inside an allowed folder. The deny check runs on
//      the path as written AND on the resolved real path, so a symlink to
//      `~/.ssh/id_rsa` is refused for what it is, not what it is called.
//   3. The REAL path must sit under an allowed root. Symlinks, `..` and 8.3 short
//      names all collapse in `realpath`, so an escape by link is refused by the
//      same containment test as any other outside path.
//   4. A path that is OUTSIDE the roots gets ONE sentence, whatever the cause
//      (missing, unreadable, a link that leads out, a plain outside file): the
//      answer must not say which outside paths exist. The cause goes to the
//      `log` option (the server's stderr). Inside the roots the errors are
//      specific (no such file, permission denied).
//   5. A host-lent FILE (doc 86 §5). A human clicking Open lends ONE file: the
//      engine stamps `_meta["ai.insodimension/grant"] = { read: [<realpath>] }` on
//      the calls of that View, and this server treats it as ONE extra file, never
//      a folder. It is checked AFTER 1 and 2 and never instead of them: a click
//      cannot open a secret. A file is lent only when the REQUESTED path, resolved
//      to its real path, equals a lent entry (no prefix, no sibling, no parent, and
//      the entry is not resolved again) and is a regular file. The engine strips the
//      key from every call it did not stamp, but this server does not rely on that:
//      a grant with any flaw (not an object, `read` not a list, a non-string or
//      relative entry, more than 8 files) is NO grant, and no grant changes nothing.
//
// The ROOTS are configuration, not a lent fact: the server is not told which
// workspace a session lives in (doc 84 gap G4) nor the engine home (the engine
// scrubs its home pointers from the environment of every child it spawns). Roots
// come from `VIEWER_ROOTS` (a path list) and `INSO_VAULT_DIR`, plus the managed
// homes an install puts under `~/.inso` / `~/.inso-dev` (`vault` = the Personal
// home, `machinist`). Refusals name `VIEWER_ROOTS` so the fix is in the message.
//
// Pure where it can be: `denyReason`, `insideRoot` and `configuredRoots` take
// their platform and inputs as arguments. Only `createFence` touches the disk
// (one `realpath` per check; a few more, on the refusal path only, and one `stat`
// for a lent file that matches), and it accepts the `realpath` and `isFile` to use.
